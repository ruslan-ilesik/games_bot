# Open source version of [Games bot](https://gamesbot.lesikr.com/).


# NOTE:
## General
This repository does contain only source code. 
You would not be able to compile it and use as it does not contain database, config template, images, dependencies, etc. 
This code can be only used for reference proposes. 
I do not provide any support regarding it.

## Work in progress.
this repository is not direct open sourcing of games bot, it is full remake of it using coroutines
and full redesign of architecture.
